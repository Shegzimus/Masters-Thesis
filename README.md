# Optimization of Solar Photovoltaic Model Parameters using Improved Whale Optimization Algorithm

## Abstract

The extraction of the parameters of solar photovoltaic models is a complex optimization problem that is nonlinear and multivariable. In this thesis, six modifications were made to the Improved Whale Optimization Algorithm (IWOA) to enhance the algorithm's effectiveness. These modifications leverage the properties of algebraic and transcendental functions to optimize the balance between exploration and exploitation in the algorithm.

To assess the efficacy of these modifications, ten experiments were conducted using ten benchmark functions. The results were then plotted and statistically analyzed to provide an overview of the algorithm's performance. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed modifications provide feasible improvements to the IWOA.
